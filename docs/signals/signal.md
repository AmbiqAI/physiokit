# Signal Processing

The `signal` submodule contains lots of underlying signal processing functionality used by the higher-level modules. This includes filtering routines, noise injection, and transformations.

## Filtering

`signal.filter` contains a number of filtering routines such as a generic second order section biquad filter, resampling, normalizing, smoothing, and more. Below we highlight a few of these routines.

## Noise Injection

`signal.noise` contains a number of noise injection routines such as Gaussian noise, uniform noise, and more. Below we highlight a few of these routines.

## Transformations

`signal.transform` contains a number of transformation routines such as the fast Fourier transform, the inverse fast Fourier transform, and more. Below we highlight a few of these routines.

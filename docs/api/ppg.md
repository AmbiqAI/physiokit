# Photoplethysmography (PPG)

Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical technique used to measure blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. PPG signals are often used to measure heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2). In PhysioKit, we provide a variety of routines for processing PPG signals.

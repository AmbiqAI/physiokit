# Inertial measurement unit (IMU)

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are electronic devices that measure and report a body's specific force (acceleration and angular velocity) and orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw). IMU signals are often used to measure activity, posture, and gait. In PhysioKit, we provide a variety of routines for processing IMU signals.

# Electrocardiogram (ECG)

Electrocardiography (ECG) is a non-invasive technique used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. ECG signals are often used to measure heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and respiratory rate. In PhysioKit, we provide a variety of routines for processing ECG signals.
